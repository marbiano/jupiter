## Strive for simplicity

Since the goal for this project is to provide with tools for other people to use, it's essential that people don't need to spend too much time figuring it out how it works.

The coding patterns that we use should be simple to understand. Most of the time, proper planning will lead to the simplest possible solution. A periodic review should be done in order to see if there's anything we could simplify.

Let's try to not overengineer it. In order to do that, we need to be smart about the tools we are using. Proper knowledge of the best Javascript, React.js and styling patterns, among others, is required.

## If complex, take notes

Sometimes you can't escape complexity. That's expected. But it doesn't mean that the solution should be built as a black box. In order to fight against this, three techniques are recommended:

- To use types properly
- To write tests
- To document code as much as possible

More time and effort are required to build a feature like this, but it introduces a context where other developers are welcome to look around. That is one of the main goals of this project.

## Understand the context

The end goal is to help online stores. So it's critical to understand what matters for an e-commerce project. Performance, reliability, security are metrics that matter the most.

Whenever we decide to implement a new feature or use an external tool, we need to ask ourselves if there's any risk at affecting any of the essential metrics.

## Make room for creativity

Different businesses might have different needs. This project should be built in an extendable way so that developers can incorporate solutions to their own unique problems.

## Have mutualistic relationships

While the project would have preferences which giant shoulders we decide to sit on, we need to make sure there's a healthy relationship between the codebase on those tools, so that we don't create such a dependency that it would be impossible to move on.

Tools come and go, and what's the best way to build an online store these days might be a deprecated technique in the future. Also, other developers might have different opinions, so we need to support for others to fork and implement in alternative ways.

## It’s not only about code

For any seasoned developer, to be able to express the reasoning behind decisions clearly is as required as writing quality code. It should be a priority of the project to be able to communicate why it's doing what it's doing.

Also, UX/UI is vital when it comes to an online store, so we need to incorporate their voices into the project, in order to form a cohesive piece of work.
